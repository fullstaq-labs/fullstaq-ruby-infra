# Editing diagrams

All diagrams' sources are stored in `.drawio` files. They are made using [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net).

If you modify a diagram, be sure to export it as SVG, using the following settings:

 * Zoom: 110%
 * Border width: 12
 * Check: Transparent Background
 * Uncheck: Include a copy of my diagram
