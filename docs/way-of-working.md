# Way of working

## Development process

 * Never push to master directly, except for documentation updates.

 * Propose all changes to the infrastructure through pull requests.

 * The person who merges a pull request is responsible for testing it after merge, and for providing feedback to the submitter if something is wrong.

See also the [pull request template](pull_request_template.md).
