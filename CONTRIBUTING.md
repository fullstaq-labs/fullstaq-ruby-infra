# Contribution guide

> You are reading the contribution guide for the **Infrastructure Team**. Interested in contributing to other parts of Fullstaq Ruby? Check the [Fullstaq Ruby Umbrella contribution guide](https://github.com/fullstaq-labs/fullstaq-ruby-umbrella/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks for considering to contribute! ðŸ˜€ We welcome all contributions, no matter who you are, and no matter whether it's big or small. With this guide, we aim to make contributing as clear and easy as possible.

Anything that helps improving the infrastructure, whether directly (through a pull request) or indirectly (by engaging with us) counts as a contribution. Here's a non-exhaustive list:

 * Reporting an infrastructure issue.
 * Triaging issues: determining whether an issue report is clear enough, whether the issue still persists, and whether it is reproducible.
 * Updating documentation.
 * Proposing an improvement.
 * Sending a pull request.

## Editing the infrastructure overview diagram

The infrastructure overview diagram's source is docs/`infrastructure-overview.drawio`. It's made using [Diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net).

If you modify it, be sure to export it as SVG, using the following settings:

 * Zoom: 110%
 * Border width: 12
 * Check: Transparent Background
 * Uncheck: Include a copy of my diagram
